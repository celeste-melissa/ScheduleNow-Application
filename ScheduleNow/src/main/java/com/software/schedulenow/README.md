# Application Title: ScheduleNow
**Purpose:** The purpose of my application was to help a global consulting organization that conducts business in
multiple languages. This organization has their main locations in Phoenix, Arizona; White Plains,
New York; Montreal, Canada; and London, England. With these details, I was tasked with the objective of creating an 
application that was able to translate based on the user's preference. The application is meant to schedule appointments 
for the user across the following countries: "U.S.", "UK", and "Canada". As a result the application has been configured 
to only allow a user to schedule appointments within the parameters of the specified countries business hours. A MYSQL 
database was provided with contact, client/customer, previously scheduled appointments, and first level divisions that 
enable the user to gather detailed reports on their contact schedules, monthly scheduled appointment count, and a 
breakdown of how many total appointments are scheduled within each specified division. I created ScheduleNow as a 
user-friendly GUI that would make scheduling appointments and gathering report information less tedious.
